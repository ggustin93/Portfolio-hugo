    <p class="lead" >
    My area of focus lies in developing web apps and mobile products. I enjoy designing and coding the UI as much as
    talking with users to iterate and improve the experiences that reach business goals üéØ However, despite my main expertise is in front-end, I also enjoy having an helicopter view on my projects and get my hand dirty into back-end as well üöÅ
    I therefore consider myself as a <b> full-stack </b> developer, a geeky jack of all trades ü§ì<br><br>
