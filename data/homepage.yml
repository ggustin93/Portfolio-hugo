  content: |
    <p class="lead">
    With a background in Biomedical Engineering (UCLouvain, 2016), I apply an analytical approach to web and software development. I strive to translate complex requirements into accessible, user-friendly applications that balance technical needs with intuitive design, with particular interest in healthcare technology.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    My journey includes work on digital health platforms during research at UCLouvain, cofounding the medtech startup MedC2 (later acquired by Comunicare) focused on patient empowerment, and supporting non-profits with digital transformation at Bruxeo. In parallel, through my web agency Pwablo, I explore and share sustainable approaches to digital practices.
    </p>
    <p class="lead">
    I aim to create thoughtful software solutions that address real needs and provide value to the organizations and people who use them.
